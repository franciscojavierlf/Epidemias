# Epidemy Simulator

An epidemy simulator made in Matlab. You can choose many variables to see how a virus would spread in a city. Change the city size, the population, how much they go out, people per house, infection spread probability. Have fun trying to see how these numbers make a virus go exponential.

To run, just copy all files into your machine, open them with the program and run it.
